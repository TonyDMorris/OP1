# OP1
Technical document for the op-1 portable synthesizer
# INFO
this was initially a freecodecamp project but now im hosting it via github pages at https://tonydmorris.github.io/OP1/.
The images have been clipped from the OP-1 online manual and as such most of them are low quality clips hosted by https://imgbb.com/.

The aim was to recreate the style of the manual pdf as closely as possible using only css.
